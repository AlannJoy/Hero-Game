- If you feel you had a bad result write a reflection on your way of working in the readme of your project.

Hey there!!: Well I feel that I didn't get the expected results at all, but even though I was completely stucked this last 2 days trying to build the logic of the game I realized I understood a bit more of the concepts and how to apply them, I also came to understand that the fact that my computer was crashing during classes I lost essencial information.

I also think that I need to practice more in a fluid way, building up concepts until my mind and my hands run the codes naturaly.

And I also would like to have a one-to-one session with a teacher to help me to identify my faults and to create a strategy.

I just focused entirely on passing the tests["Sorry!!"]

Thanks: Alan
